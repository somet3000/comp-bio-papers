A Collection of Interesting Computational Biology Papers and Resources I have come across.

### Project Organization
[A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424&ref=https://githubhelp.com): Came across this paper during my DSC 180 capstone methodology class at UCSD. A paper explaining one way to structure computational biology experiments. Provides thoughts on how to manage directory structures for computational biology projects.

[Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/): Came across this website during my DSC 180 capstone methodology class. A website which provides a generic data structure well-suited for data science projects and creating reproducible analyses.
